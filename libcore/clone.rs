//! The `Clone` trait for types that cannot be 'implicitly copied'.
//!
//! In Rust, some simple types are "implicitly copyable" and when you
//! assign them or pass them as arguments, the receiver will get a copy,
//! leaving the original value in place. These types do not require
//! allocation to copy and do not have finalizers (i.e. they do not
//! contain owned boxes or implement `Drop`), so the compiler considers
//! them cheap and safe to copy. For other types copies must be made
//! explicitly, by convention implementing the `Clone` trait and calling
//! the `clone` method.
//!
//! Basic usage example:
//!
//! ```
//! let s = String::new(); // String type implements Clone
//! let copy = s.clone(); // so we can clone it
//! ```
//!
//! To easily implement the Clone trait, you can also use
//! `#[derive(Clone)]`. Example:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Clone)] // we add the Clone trait to Morpheus struct
//! struct Morpheus {
//!    blue_pill: f32,
//!    red_pill: i64,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    let f = Morpheus { blue_pill: 0.0, red_pill: 0 };
//!    let copy = f.clone(); // and now we can clone it!
//! }
//! ```

/// A common trait for the ability to explicitly duplicate an object.
///
/// Differs from `Copy` in that `Copy` is implicit and extremely inexpensive, while
/// `Clone` is always explicit and may or may not be expensive. In order to enforce
/// these characteristics, Rust does not allow you to reimplement `Copy`, but you
/// may reimplement `Clone` and run arbitrary code.
///
/// Since `Clone` is more general than `Copy`, you can automatically make anything
/// `Copy` be `Clone` as well.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]` if all fields are `Clone`. The `derive`d
/// implementation of `clone()` calls `clone()` on each field.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Clone`?
///
/// Types that are `Copy` should have a trivial implementation of `Clone`. More formally:
/// if `T: Copy`, `x: T`, and `y: &T`, then `let x = y.clone();` is equivalent to `let x = *y;`.
/// Manual implementations should be careful to uphold this invariant; however, unsafe code
/// must not rely on it to ensure memory safety.
///
/// An example is an array holding more than 32 elements of a type that is `Clone`; the standard
/// library only implements `Clone` up until arrays of size 32. In this case, the implementation of
/// `Clone` cannot be `derive`d, but can be implemented as:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Copy)]
/// struct Stats {
///    frequencies: [i32; 100],
/// }
///
/// impl Clone for Stats {
///     fn clone(&self) -> Stats { *self }
/// }
/// ```
