//! Atomic types
//!
//! Atomic types provide primitive shared-memory communication between
//! threads, and are the building blocks of other concurrent
//! types.
//!
//! This module defines atomic versions of a select number of primitive
//! types, including `AtomicBool`, `AtomicIsize`, and `AtomicUsize`.
//! Atomic types present operations that, when used correctly, synchronize
//! updates between threads.
//!
//! Each method takes an `Ordering` which represents the strength of
//! the memory barrier for that operation. These orderings are the
//! same as [LLVM atomic orderings][1].
//!
//! [1]: http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#memory-model-for-concurrent-operations
//!
//! Atomic variables are safe to share between threads (they implement `Sync`)
//! but they do not themselves provide the mechanism for sharing and follow the
//! [threading model](../../../std/thread/index.html#the-threading-model) of rust.
//! The most common way to share an atomic variable is to put it into an `Arc` (an
//! atomically-reference-counted shared pointer).
//!
//! Most atomic types may be stored in static variables, initialized using
//! the provided static initializers like `ATOMIC_BOOL_INIT`. Atomic statics
//! are often used for lazy global initialization.
//!
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A simple spinlock:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let spinlock = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(1));
//!
//!     let spinlock_clone = spinlock.clone();
//!     let thread = thread::spawn(move|| {
//!         spinlock_clone.store(0, Ordering::SeqCst);
//!     });
//!
//!     // Wait for the other thread to release the lock
//!     while spinlock.load(Ordering::SeqCst) != 0 {}
//!
//!     if let Err(panic) = thread.join() {
//!         println!("Thread had an error: {:?}", panic);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Keep a global count of live threads:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};
//!
//! static GLOBAL_THREAD_COUNT: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;
//!
//! let old_thread_count = GLOBAL_THREAD_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
//! println!("live threads: {}", old_thread_count + 1);
//! ```

/// A fence 'A' which has `Release` ordering semantics, synchronizes with a

/// atomic operations X and Y, both operating on some atomic object 'M' such
/// that A is sequenced before X, Y is synchronized before B and Y observes
/// the change to M. This provides a happens-before dependence between A and B.
///
/// Atomic operations with `Release` or `Acquire` semantics can also synchronize
/// with a fence.

/// A fence which has `SeqCst` ordering, in addition to having both `Acquire`
/// and `Release` semantics, participates in the global program order of the
