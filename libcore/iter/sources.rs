/// Infinite iterators like `repeat()` are often used with adapters like

/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:

/// ```
/// use std::iter;

/// // the number four 4ever:
/// let mut fours = iter::repeat(4);
///
/// assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());

/// assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());
/// assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());

/// // yup, still four

/// Going finite with [`take()`]:

/// ```

/// // that last example was too many fours. Let's only have four fours.
