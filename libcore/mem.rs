/// Leaks a value into the void, consuming ownership and never running its
/// destructor.
///
/// This function will take ownership of its argument, but is distinct from the
/// `mem::drop` function in that it **does not run the destructor**, leaking the
/// value and any resources that it owns.
///
/// There's only a few reasons to use this function. They mainly come
/// up in unsafe code or FFI code.
///
/// * You have an uninitialized value, perhaps for performance reasons, and
///   need to prevent the destructor from running on it.
/// * You have two copies of a value (like when writing something like
///   [`mem::swap`][swap]), but need the destructor to only run once to
///   prevent a double `free`.
/// * Transferring resources across [FFI][ffi] boundaries.
///
/// [swap]: fn.swap.html
/// [ffi]: ../../book/ffi.html
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is not marked as `unsafe` as Rust does not guarantee that the
/// `Drop` implementation for a value will always run. Note, however, that
/// leaking resources such as memory or I/O objects is likely not desired, so
/// this function is only recommended for specialized use cases.
///
/// The safety of this function implies that when writing `unsafe` code
/// yourself care must be taken when leveraging a destructor that is required to
/// run to preserve memory safety. There are known situations where the
/// destructor may not run (such as if ownership of the object with the
/// destructor is returned) which must be taken into account.
///
/// # Other forms of Leakage
///
/// It's important to point out that this function is not the only method by
/// which a value can be leaked in safe Rust code. Other known sources of
/// leakage are:
///
/// * `Rc` and `Arc` cycles
/// * `mpsc::{Sender, Receiver}` cycles (they use `Arc` internally)
/// * Panicking destructors are likely to leak local resources
///
/// # Example
///
/// Leak some heap memory by never deallocating it:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let heap_memory = Box::new(3);
/// mem::forget(heap_memory);
/// ```
///
/// Leak an I/O object, never closing the file:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// let file = File::open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// mem::forget(file);
/// ```
///
/// The `mem::swap` function uses `mem::forget` to good effect:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// fn swap<T>(x: &mut T, y: &mut T) {
///     unsafe {
///         // Give ourselves some scratch space to work with
///         let mut t: T = mem::uninitialized();
///
///         // Perform the swap, `&mut` pointers never alias
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*x, &mut t, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*y, x, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&t, y, 1);
///
///         // y and t now point to the same thing, but we need to completely
///         // forget `t` because we do not want to run the destructor for `T`
///         // on its value, which is still owned somewhere outside this function.
///         mem::forget(t);
///     }

/// # Undefined Behavior
///
/// It is Undefined Behavior to read uninitialized memory. Even just an

/// a boolean your program may take one, both, or neither of the branches.
///
/// Note that this often also includes *writing* to the uninitialized value.
/// Rust believes the value is initialized, and will therefore try to Drop
/// the uninitialized value and its fields if you try to overwrite the memory
/// in a normal manner. The only way to safely initialize an arbitrary
/// uninitialized value is with one of the `ptr` functions: `write`, `copy`, or
/// `copy_nonoverlapping`. This isn't necessary if `T` is a primitive
/// or otherwise only contains types that don't implement Drop.
///
/// If this value *does* need some kind of Drop, it must be initialized before
/// it goes out of scope (and therefore would be dropped). Note that this
/// includes a `panic` occurring and unwinding the stack suddenly.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here's how to safely initialize an array of `Vec`s.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// // Only declare the array. This safely leaves it
/// // uninitialized in a way that Rust will track for us.
/// // However we can't initialize it element-by-element
/// // safely, and we can't use the `[value; 1000]`
/// // constructor because it only works with `Copy` data.
/// let mut data: [Vec<u32>; 1000];
///
/// unsafe {
///     // So we need to do this to initialize it.
///     data = mem::uninitialized();
///
///     // DANGER ZONE: if anything panics or otherwise
///     // incorrectly reads the array here, we will have
///     // Undefined Behavior.
///
///     // It's ok to mutably iterate the data, since this
///     // doesn't involve reading it at all.
///     // (ptr and len are statically known for arrays)
///     for elem in &mut data[..] {
///         // *elem = Vec::new() would try to drop the
///         // uninitialized memory at `elem` -- bad!
///         //
///         // Vec::new doesn't allocate or do really
///         // anything. It's only safe to call here
///         // because we know it won't panic.
///         ptr::write(elem, Vec::new());
///     }
///
///     // SAFE ZONE: everything is initialized.
/// }
///
/// println!("{:?}", &data[0]);
/// ```
///
/// This example emphasizes exactly how delicate and dangerous doing this is.
/// Note that the `vec!` macro *does* let you initialize every element with a
/// value that is only `Clone`, so the following is semantically equivalent and
/// vastly less dangerous, as long as you can live with an extra heap
/// allocation:
///
/// ```
/// let data: Vec<Vec<u32>> = vec![Vec::new(); 1000];
