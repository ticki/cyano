//! Bit fiddling on positive IEEE 754 floats. Negative numbers aren't and needn't be handled.
//! Normal floating point numbers have a canonical representation as (frac, exp) such that the
//! value is 2^exp * (1 + sum(frac[N-i] / 2^i)) where N is the number of bits. Subnormals are
//! slightly different and weird, but the same principle applies.
//!
//! Here, however, we represent them as (sig, k) with f positive, such that the value is f * 2^e.
//! Besides making the "hidden bit" explicit, this changes the exponent by the so-called
//! mantissa shift.
//!
//! Put another way, normally floats are written as (1) but here they are written as (2):
//!
//! 1. `1.101100...11 * 2^m`
//! 2. `1101100...11 * 2^n`
//!
//! We call (1) the **fractional representation** and (2) the **integral representation**.
//!
//! Many functions in this module only handle normal numbers. The dec2flt routines conservatively
//! take the universally-correct slow path (Algorithm M) for very small and very large numbers.
//! That algorithm needs only next_float() which does handle subnormals and zeros.
